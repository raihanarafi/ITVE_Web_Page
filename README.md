# ITVE Landing Page

## 1. Project Overview
This project is a professional, high-performance landing page for **ITVE** (Institute of Technical and Vocational Excellence). It is a dynamic web application built with **React** that displays information and educational offerings in a clean, organized gallery format.

**Key sections include:**
* **About ITVE:** A clear introduction to the institute's mission and value.
* **Programs & Offerings:** A dynamic gallery of available courses.
* **Student Engagement:** A dedicated portal and contact sections for prospective students.

## 2. Tech Stack Used
