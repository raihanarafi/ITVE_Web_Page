# ITVE Landing Page

## 1. Project Overview
This project is a professional, high-performance landing page for **ITVE** (Institute of Technical and Vocational Excellence). It is a dynamic web application built with **React** that displays information and educational offerings in a clean, organized gallery format. 

The main goal of this application is to provide a seamless user experience for browsing through different sections—such as courses, achievements, and institute updates—without overwhelming the user with too much information at once.

**Key sections include:**
* **About ITVE:** A clear introduction to the institute's mission and value.
* **Programs & Offerings:** A dynamic gallery of available courses.
* **Student Engagement:** A dedicated portal and contact sections for prospective students.

## 2. Tech Stack Used
* **React.js:** Core library for building the user interface.
* **Tailwind CSS:** For professional, responsive styling.
* **JavaScript (ES6+):** For state-driven logic and interactivity.
* **Vercel:** For automated deployment and hosting.
* **Utility-First Styling:** By using Tailwind CSS, I ensured that the styling is consistent across all components. This also made the website much faster to load because Tailwind removes all unused CSS before the site goes live.
