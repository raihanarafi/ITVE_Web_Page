# React Data Gallery

## 1. Project Overview
This project is a dynamic web application built with React that displays a collection of data in a clean, organized gallery format. The main goal of this application is to provide a seamless user experience for browsing through large sets of items (including images) without overwhelming the user, thanks to a custom pagination system.

Key features include:
* **Dynamic Data Rendering:** Pulling information and images into a responsive layout.
* **Image Management:** Efficiently handling assets via the public directory for fast loading.
* **Live Deployment:** Hosted on Vercel with automated CI/CD via GitHub.
